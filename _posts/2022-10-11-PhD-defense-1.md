PhD defense

On November 25th at 10AM (GMT+2) I will publicly defend my PhD dissertation in the aula of Tilburg University, which is titled “Managerial Attention, Emotion, and Communication in Corporate Financial Distress”. I am incredibly excited and proud to have reached this milestone! For those interested, more information regarding the defense can be found in the link below, including a link to the livestream.
