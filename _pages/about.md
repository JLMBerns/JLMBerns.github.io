I am a [PhD Candidate](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/nl/medewerkers/j-l-m-berns) at the Management Department at Tilburg University and will graduate in late 2022.

(2022.6.28) I am open for new opportunities starting September 2022.

My research builds on and contributes to behavioral decision-making, corporate governance, and corporate communication literatures. Specifically, I am interested in understanding the behavior of top management teams when they face threats that may cause their organization severe harm. This includes how perceptions of severe threats form, why there is considerable heterogeneity across executive's perceptions of such threats, and how these perceptions affect managerial behavior, including risk-taking and strategic communication.

In my research I use a variety of methods and employ a wide range of data types, and am specifically interested in advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for analyzing textual and audio data.

My supervisors are [Prof. Dr. Tal Simons](https://www.rsm.nl/people/tal-simons/) and [Prof. Dr. Zilin He](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/staff/z-l-he).
