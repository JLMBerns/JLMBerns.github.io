I am a tenure track [Assistant Professor](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/nl/medewerkers/j-l-m-berns) at the Organzation Studies department at Tilburg University.

My research primarily speaks to behavioral decision-making, corporate governance, and corporate communication literatures. Specifically, I am interested in understanding the behavior of executives when they face threats that may cause their organization severe harm. This includes how perceptions of severe threats form, why there is considerable heterogeneity across executive's perceptions of such threats, and how these perceptions affect managerial behavior, including risk-taking and strategic communication.

Several of my projects focus on executives' voice, which is the manner in which they speak (e.g., their tone, tempo, emotionality), as voice holds interesting clues about their (private) beliefs and preferences.

In my research I use a variety of methods and employ a wide range of data types, and am specifically interested in advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for analyzing textual and audio data.
