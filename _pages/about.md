I am an [Assistant Professor](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/nl/medewerkers/j-l-m-berns) at the Organization Studies department at Tilburg University.

My research primarily speaks to behavioral decision-making, corporate governance, and corporate communication literatures. Among others, I am interested in understanding the behavior of executives when they face threats that may cause their organization severe harm. In my research I use a variety of methods and employ a wide range of data types, and am specifically interested in advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for analyzing textual and audio data.

Below snippets of selected research projects:
- Combining audio and textual data of CEOs to study how analysts change ratings
- Using textual data to investigate how CEOs are not only influenced by their legal ownership of their firms, but also the role of 'ownership feelings'
- Exploring the dynamics involving how banks' focus of attention shifts after a great shock
- With audio and textual data, studying how different factors determine how fast or slow a CEO speaks
- Demonstrating the tension between the evaluation of critics and the broader audience in the high-end Dutch hospitality industry
