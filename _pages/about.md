I am an [Assistant Professor](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/nl/medewerkers/j-l-m-berns) at the Organization Studies department at Tilburg University.

My research primarily speaks to behavioral decision-making, corporate governance, and corporate communication literatures. Among others, I am interested in understanding the behavior of executives when they face threats that may cause their organization severe harm. In my research I use a variety of methods and employ a wide range of data types, and am specifically interested in advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for analyzing textual and audio data.
