I am a PhD Candidate at the Management Department at Tilburg University and will graduate in late 2022.

In my research I try to uncover how organizations and their top management team behave when being faced with financial distress. The first major theme is trying to understand their decision-making through how reference points affect their risk-taking. A second theme focuses on their communication, examining how they verbally describe to external analysts how well their organization is doing. In my research I use a large variety of methods, ranging from advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for analyzing textual and audio data, to using survival models.

My supervisors are [Prof. Dr. Tal Simons](https://www.rsm.nl/people/tal-simons/) and [Prof. Dr. Zilin He](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/staff/z-l-he).
