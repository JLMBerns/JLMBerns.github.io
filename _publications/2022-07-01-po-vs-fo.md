A central question in management theory is how shareholders can align managerial interests with their own interests, which is believed to be achieved by awarding management with formal ownership (e.g., shares). However, there is an abundance of literature that suggests that managers are also motivated by non-monetary factors. Although non-monetary factors affect formal ownership, this interaction has received scant scholarly attention. Specifically, we examine the interaction between formal ownership and psychological ownership. We compare the two types of ownership and study whether one affects managers in the absence of the other, employing the context of disappointing performance affecting managerial emotions. Using earnings calls, we measure psychological ownership by examining managers' use of possessive language and compare it to the shares (and options) these managers hold. We find support for the moderating role of psychological ownership, and find evidence that for ownership mechanisms to affect managerial behavior, both ownership types need to be present for any of the two to influence managers. This study contributes to behavioral decision-making literature by demonstrating the interrelationship between how ownership-based mechanisms are not solely based on monetary aspects, but also psychological in nature. Furthermore, it offers a contribution to agency theory, in showing that for managerial incentives to be effective, there needs to be attention to the accompanying psychological aspects.
